# GitAutoStreak Test Repository

This repository is used to store the commit data generated by the **GitAutoStreak** application. It serves as a testing environment for ensuring that commits are being made regularly to keep your GitHub contribution streak alive. This repository tracks all automated commit actions performed by the GitAutoStreak app.

## Purpose

The repository's purpose is to act as a test repository for the GitAutoStreak app. Commits made to this repository help maintain an active contribution streak on your GitHub profile. It should not be used for actual project development; it is purely for testing commit automation.

## Features

- **Automated Commit Storage**: Stores all the commits made by the GitAutoStreak app to keep your GitHub streak going.
- **Commit Log Tracking**: Keeps a log of each commit made, including timestamps and commit messages.
- **Non-Project Repo**: A repository for testing and maintaining commit activity, separate from your main projects.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains the following structure:

```
/
|-- .gitignore                # Files and directories to ignore in commits
|-- README.md                 # This README file
|-- auto-commit-history.log   # Log file storing commit timestamps and messages
|-- commit_data/              # Directory storing the commit-related data
|   |-- commit_001.txt        # Example commit file generated by the app
|   |-- commit_002.txt        # Another generated commit file
```

### File Details:
- **`.gitignore`**: A file listing the files that should be ignored by Git. Typically, this includes logs and other temporary files.
- **`README.md`**: The file you’re currently reading.
- **`auto-commit-history.log`**: A log file that records the details of every automated commit made to this repository. This includes timestamps and commit messages.
- **`commit_data/`**: A folder where each commit generates a new file (e.g., `commit_001.txt`). These files simulate the changes made by the GitAutoStreak app.

## Usage

1. **Track Commit History**: Every time the GitAutoStreak app commits, you’ll see a new entry in the `auto-commit-history.log` file, along with a new file in the `commit_data/` folder. 
   
2. **Inspect Commit Data**: The `commit_data/` folder contains individual files created as part of the commit. Each file corresponds to a commit and helps visualize the data associated with the commit.

3. **View Commit Logs**: To see a detailed log of each commit made, refer to the `auto-commit-history.log` file. This log will include information like:
    - Timestamp of the commit
    - Commit message used by the GitAutoStreak app

This repository is designed for testing purposes, so direct contributions are not expected. However, if you encounter issues or have suggestions for improving the GitAutoStreak process, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
